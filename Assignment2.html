			<button id="Power">On/Off</button>
			<button id="Charge">Charge</button>
		</p>
		
		<div id="Task"></div>
		
		<canvas id="robot" width="600" height="550"></canvas>
		
		<section>
			<p>Explanation:</p>
			<p>The robot will take a few seconds to load, to give time for the images to load.</p>
			<p>When the 'On/Off' button is pressed, the robots eyes will light up to signify it is 'On'. When pressed again, the eyes will turn off to signify 'Off'.</p>
			<p>When click any part of the canvas, lasers will shoot from the robots eyes to the location clicked. When a new task is done, the laser is cleared off the canvas.</p>
			<p>However, if the far right or left side of the canvas is clicked, the robot will shift in that direction.</p>
			<p>If the right or left arm is clicked, that arm will spin for 2 seconds.</p>
			<p>After 3 tasks have been done, the robot turns itself off.</p>
			<p>When the 'Charge' button is pressed, you must wait a few seconds until the robot charges fully. The robot will charge if at least 1 task has been done.</p>
			<p>When the window is resized, the canvas adjusts so it is visible on the screen and the coordinates stay relative. Therefore it is mobile and desktop responsive.</p>
